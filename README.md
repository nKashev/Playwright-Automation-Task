# Playwright-interview-task

A QA automation job application with a walk-through demonstration of my code, showing a successful execution of following task:

"In this assignment, you will create a script on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) using JavaScript and Microsoft's [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) framework. 

1. Install node modules by running `npm i`.

2. Edit the `index.js` file in this project to go to [Hacker News/newest](https://news.ycombinator.com/newest) and validate that EXACTLY the first 100 articles are sorted from newest to oldest. You can run your script with the `node index.js` command.

Note that you are welcome to update Playwright or install other packages as you see fit, however you must utilize Playwright in this assignment."

Extra:
I converted the logic of ValidateHackerNewsArticles function to Playwright test.

I created workflows to run daily tests on various browsers on the latest Windows and Ubuntu operating systems.
